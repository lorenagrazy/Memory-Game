<h2 align="center"> :clipboard: About the Project </h2>
  
   
<div align="center">
The memory game is a classic game made up of pieces that have a figure on one side. <br> Each figure is repeated in two different parts. <br> To start the game, the pieces are placed face down so that they cannot be seen. Each participant must, in turn, <br> turn over two pieces and let everyone see them. If the figures are the same, <br> the participant must pick up that pair and play again. If they are different pieces, <br> they must be turned over again, and the turn is passed to the next participant. <br> Whoever has the most pairs at the end of the game wins the game.
